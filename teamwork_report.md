# Teamwork report

## Identification of purpose of web site to the appropriate stakeholders with relevant and appropriate content for the web site.

We have created a google [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tfaKhfdmxU8v94HCKhkvlIEuj2hCdYJNumCFyu89VbM/edit#gid=0) where every team member shares their vision on the following topics:

1. Purpose of the web site
2. Theme park web site examples
3. Content for the web site
4. Structure of the web site

All team members completed their parts of the document with their thoughts and examples.
We have discussed in Slack different possibilities, and then compilated the best variants into the single [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11PB0dJrm_aulKpa5li6ttBLw99rNJeCVgobs960AicM/edit). This document was the guide of all of our following work.

We have identified the following stakeholders:
1. visitors: families, couples, tourists who love nature
2. park administration
3. various service providers: shops, hotels, etc.

We have agreed that the purpose of the website should be the following:
1. Attract more customers
2. Advertise park
3. Provides information about the park (location of the park, map, opening hours, types of park attractions)
3. Ticket prices and online ticket shop
